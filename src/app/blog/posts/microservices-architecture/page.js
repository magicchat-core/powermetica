          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Microservices architecture has become the standard for building scalable, maintainable 
            applications. Unlike monolithic architectures, microservices allow teams to develop, 
            deploy, and scale services independently, leading to faster development cycles and 
            improved reliability.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Decomposition</h2>
          <p>
            Properly decompose your application into bounded contexts and single responsibility services. 
            Each microservice should have a clearly defined purpose and own its data storage. Use domain-driven 
            design principles to identify service boundaries.
          </p>

          <h2>API Gateway Pattern</h2>
          <p>
            Implement API gateways to handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting. API gateways 
            act as a single entry point for clients, simplifying the client-side code and providing 
            a centralized place for cross-cutting concerns.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            Use service discovery patterns to dynamically locate services in your architecture. 
            Tools like Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes service discovery help manage the dynamic 
            nature of microservices environments.
          </p>

          <h2>Event-Driven Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            Implement event-driven communication between services using message brokers like Kafka, 
            RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS/SQS. This enables loose coupling and improves system resilience.
          </p>

          <h2>Containerization and Orchestration</h2>
          <p>
            Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. This provides 
            consistent deployment environments, scalability, and self-healing capabilities 
            for your microservices.
          </p>
